# core

core repo in .md form - will likely move to better looking version at some point

## Thought process behind this repo

I think it'd be quite useful to have a simple and concise overview of core/essential Christian theology.

I want to create a repository that gives the leading interpretations and views on a wide variety of Christian subjects/theology, seeking to create a readable and understandable yet concise and detailed overview of the topics.

I have my own predispositions but I want to minimize my own input, simply allowing the Bible to speak the truth on these subjects and using the knowledge of the experts, scholars, and fellow brothers and sisters in Christ that have gone before me to lay out a concise explanation.

## Overview of what this repo will cover

### Primary Goal: Clear and simple overview of core and hot-topic/relevant Christian issues

#### Topic Ideas:
- Homosexuality
- Women in positions of the church
- Eschatology (The end times)
- Baptism
- Charismata (gifts of the Spirit)
- Who is going to heaven (vs hell)
- Creation
- Worship
- Salvation
- TULIP
- Total depravity of man
- Trinity
- Mission
- Church government
- Biblical authority
- Lord's supper
- Offices in the church
- Abortion

#### How I will write up the analysis of the above topics
  1. List Verses primarily, explaining and giving context, reasoning and commentary.
  2. List famous Christian authors, professors, pastors, etc. and there statements on the subject
  3. Give a numerical analysis of the proofs and arguments presented
  4. note the level of importance in relation to other issues and the Gospel itself (possibly also numerical)

#### II. Pointing to the Gospel
explaining how things point to the Gospel message and narrative
  1. Christian things:
    - O.T. passages, N.T. passages that may have previously not have been so clear
    - Christian music, worship
  2. Everything else:
    - Movies, books, music (lyrics), literature, other that points to the Gospel or can help explain

#### III. Unknown, new territory
Anything and everything that peaks my interest and seems particularly relevant to Christianity.
